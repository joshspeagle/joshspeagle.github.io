            <h2 class="section-title">What do I do?</h2>

            <p><strong>My research focuses on four main areas:</strong></p>
            <ul class="research-areas">
                <li><strong>Statistical Learning & AI</strong>:
                    Developing novel methods to discover underlying patterns from (many) large, messy datasets
                </li>
                <li><strong>Interpretability & Insight</strong>:
                    Building up a rigorous understanding of how statistical
                    methods work both in theory and in practice
                    in order to extract novel scientific insights</li>
                <li><strong>Inference & Computation</strong>:
                    Establishing robust frameworks and designing tractable
                    algorithms to efficiently quantify how much
                    we can learn from data</li>
                <li><strong>Discovery & Understanding</strong>:
                    Applying these methods to large-scale astronomical surveys
                    to uncover new insights about the
                    universe, with a focus on how galaxies like our own Milky Way form, behave, and evolve over time.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This work often involves working with massive datasets from wide-field imaging and spectroscopic surveys
                containing observations ranging from billions of stars and galaxies to interstellar gas and dust,
                but can also include smaller datasets from targeted observations of individual objeects along with
                everything in between.

                    <p>I spent a lot of my childhood shuttling back and forth between the <strong>United States</strong>
                        and <strong>China</strong>, splitting my time between small suburban cities around Milwaukee,
                        Wisconsin and the mega-cities of Beijing and Shanghai. After settling down in Brookfield,
                        Wisconsin in my teenage years, I fell in love with astronomy and physics around the age of 17
                        after reading a copy of <a

                            Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time</a> by <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll">Sean Carroll</a>.</p>

                    <p>This led me to move in 2011 to Boston, Massachusetts, to pursue my studies at <a
                            href="http://www.harvard.edu/"><strong>Harvard University</strong></a>, where I completed my
                        Bachelor's Degree with Honors jointly in Astrophysics and Physics in 2015. During my time at
                        Harvard, I participated in multiple research projects across a wide range of topics in astronomy
                        with truly wonderful mentors.</p>

            <p>What struck me across these projects was the extent to which so much of science depended on robust
                statistical analysis and computational methods. This led me to shift my research focus to the
                intersection of astrophysics, statistics, and computer science, namely <strong>astrostatistics</strong>
                and <strong>data science</strong>. In 2015, I moved to Kashiwa, Japan to work with <a
                    href="https://alexie.sites.ucsc.edu/">Alexie Leauthaud</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.ucolick.org/~kbundy/">Kevin Bundy</a> at the <a
                    href="http://www.ipmu.jp/"><strong>Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the
                        Universe</strong></a> (Kavli IPMU).</p>

            <p>In 2016 I returned to Boston to pursue my graduate studies in the <a
                    href="http://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/">Department of Astronomy</a> at Harvard. I received my
                Master's and Doctoral Degrees in 2020 under the joint supervision of <a
                    href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink/">Doug Finkbeiner</a>, <a
                    href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/home/">Charlie Conroy</a>, <a
                    href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/agoodman">Alyssa Goodman</a>, and <a
                    href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/deisenstein/">Daniel Eisenstein</a>. My final thesis, <a
                    href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37365889"><strong>"Mapping the Milky Way in the Age of
                        Gaia"</strong></a>, was only possible thanks to the broad range of expertise provided by my
                advisers and collaborators.</p>

            <p>Following my second stint at Harvard, I moved to Toronto, Canada in 2020 to work under the supervision of
                <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/intro.html">Gwen Eadie</a> as a <a
                    href="https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/2019-2020-eng.html">Banting Fellow</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/people/dunlap-fellows/">Dunlap Fellow</a> at the <a
                    href="https://www.utoronto.ca/"><strong>University of Toronto</strong></a>. In 2022, I was extremely
                fortunate to be able to join her as the second <strong>Assistant Professor in Astrostatistics</strong>
                jointly appointed between the Department of Statistical Sciences and the David A. Dunlap Department of
                Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto.

            <p>Outside of work, I mostly enjoy hanging out at home or going out with my wife, Rebecca, our two dogs,
                Kumo and Aki (pictured below), and our son, Atlas. I also watch way too much anime, play way too many
                video games, and have a supremely unhealthy love of junk food and soda.</p>
