                <h3>Research Focus</h3>
                <p><strong>My research focuses on using a combination of astronomy, statistics, and data science to understand how galaxies like our own Milky Way form, behave, and evolve over time.</strong> This often involves working with massive datasets from wide-field imaging and spectroscopic surveys containing observations ranging from billions of stars and galaxies to interstellar gas and dust.</p>
            </div>

            <p>I also teach both undergraduate and graduate courses in statistics and astronomy, serve on a few committees (both within the University of Toronto and some professional societies such as the <a href="https://aas.org/">AAS</a>, <a href="https://astrostat.org/">ASA-AIG</a>, and <a href="https://ssc.ca/en/about/sections-regions/data-science-and-analytics">SSC-DSA</a>), and help manage the <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/academics/undergraduate-studies/surp-2/">Astronomy & Astrophysics Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)</a> (the largest of its kind in Canada!).</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                <p>I am incredibly fortunate to co-lead the interdisciplinary <strong><a href="https://astrostatuoft.com/">Astrostatistics Research Team (ART)</a></strong> along with <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/cover.html">Gwen Eadie</a>.

            <div class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <p>I spent a lot of my childhood shuttling back and forth between the <strong>United States</strong> and <strong>China</strong>, splitting my time between small suburban cities around Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the mega-cities of Beijing and Shanghai. After settling down in Brookfield, Wisconsin in my teenage years, I fell in love with astronomy and physics around the age of 17 after reading a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Eternity_to_Here:_The_Quest_for_the_Ultimate_Theory_of_Time">From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll">Sean Carroll</a>.</p>

                    <p>This led me to move in 2011 to Boston, Massachusetts, to pursue my studies at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/"><strong>Harvard University</strong></a>, where I completed my Bachelor's Degree with Honors jointly in Astrophysics and Physics in 2015. During my time at Harvard, I participated in multiple research projects across a wide range of topics in astronomy with truly wonderful mentors.</p>

            </div>

            <p>What struck me across these projects was the extent to which so much of science depended on robust statistical analysis and computational methods. This led me to shift my research focus to the intersection of astrophysics, statistics, and computer science, namely <strong>astrostatistics</strong> and <strong>data science</strong>. In 2015, I moved to Kashiwa, Japan to work with <a href="https://alexie.sites.ucsc.edu/">Alexie Leauthaud</a> and <a href="https://www.ucolick.org/~kbundy/">Kevin Bundy</a> at the <a href="http://www.ipmu.jp/"><strong>Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe</strong></a> (Kavli IPMU).</p>

            <p>In 2016 I returned to Boston to pursue my graduate studies in the <a href="http://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/">Department of Astronomy</a> at Harvard. I received my Master's and Doctoral Degrees in 2020 under the joint supervision of <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink/">Doug Finkbeiner</a>, <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/home/">Charlie Conroy</a>, <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/agoodman">Alyssa Goodman</a>, and <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/deisenstein/">Daniel Eisenstein</a>. My final thesis, <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37365889"><strong>"Mapping the Milky Way in the Age of Gaia"</strong></a>, was only possible thanks to the broad range of expertise provided by my advisers and collaborators.</p>

            <p>Following my second stint at Harvard, I moved to Toronto, Canada in 2020 to work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/intro.html">Gwen Eadie</a> as a <a href="https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/2019-2020-eng.html">Banting Fellow</a> and <a href="https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/people/dunlap-fellows/">Dunlap Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/"><strong>University of Toronto</strong></a>. In 2022, I was extremely fortunate to be able to join her as the second <strong>Assistant Professor in Astrostatistics</strong> jointly appointed between the Department of Statistical Sciences and the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I mostly enjoy hanging out at home or going out with my wife, Rebecca, our two dogs, Kumo and Aki (pictured below), and our son, Atlas. I also watch way too much anime, play way too many video games, and have a supremely unhealthy love of junk food and soda.</p>

        <section id="teaching" class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Teaching</h2>
            
            <p>I have a strong interest in education and pedagogy, with a focus on practical skills such as programming, applied statistics, and data science that are invaluable but not often taught as part of a typical science curriculum. As part of my teaching, I try to develop online, interactive, and publicly available resources that facilitate "flipped classroom" environments focused on encouraging student engagement.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Educational Resources</h3>
                <p>I work on publishing pedagogical texts and creating interactive resources. I also am a firm believer in peer-to-peer knowledge exchange as an integral part of learning about science and serve as an active participant in many journal clubs and discussion groups.</p>
            </div>

            <p>I founded and organized the Machine Learning Journal Club at the <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/">Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian</a> from 2017-2020, and co-founded and organize the Statistics & Machine LEarning (SMILE) discussion group in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto.</p>

            <div class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <h3>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion</h3>
                    <p>For centuries, explicit and implicit discrimination have barred individuals from many backgrounds from participating fully and freely in science. As scientists and people, I feel we have a duty to address these injustices to both better our profession as well as society at large. I endeavor to create an environment in which all members feel that their diverse backgrounds can be an integral part of their identity as a scientist.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Open Science</h3>
                    <p>I am a big proponent of open, accessible, and reproducible science. When conducting research, my collaborators and I make an active effort to share results along with data products and code. I also love making and sharing interactive visualizations from our projects and ensure <a href="https://github.com/joshspeagle/">my code</a> remains public and well-documented.</p>

                <h3>Opportunities for Students</h3>
                
                <h4>Graduate Students</h4>
                <p>While you are welcome to reach out to chat about my work, I cannot directly admit graduate students. If you are interested in potentially working with me, I would encourage you to apply to the Department of Statistical Sciences and/or David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics Master's/Doctoral program streams.</p>

                <h4>Undergraduate Students</h4>
                <p>My general policy is not to accept students through ad hoc channels. Instead, I often post opportunities through existing program streams to ensure a broader cohort of potential applicants whose materials can be reviewed in a more inclusive and equitable manner.</p>

                <p><strong>Current University of Toronto students:</strong> Opportunities include the Faculty of Arts & Science Research Opportunity Program (ROP), the University of Toronto Work Study Program (WSP), and various independent study courses.</p>
