My supervisor is <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/cover.html">Gwen Eadie</a>.

      <p>
	Modern astronomy is filled with massive datasets from wide-field imaging and spectroscopic surveys containing billions of stars and galaxies to radio observations of interstellar gas and dust. My research focuses on using a combination of astronomy, statistics, and computer science to combine and analyze these large datasets to better understand the how galaxies like our own Milky Way form, behave, and evolve over time. More details can be found on my <a href="https://joshspeagle.github.io/research/">Research</a> page.
      </p>

      <p>
	I consider mentorship and collaboration to be at the heart of much my research and love working with students, postdocs, and faculty across disciplines. A somewhat complete list of mentees can be found <a href="https://github.com/joshspeagle/bio-cv/blob/gh-pages/mentees_speagle.pdf">here</a>. If you're interested in working with me on a short-term or long-term project, please don't hesitate to reach out.
      </p>

	I am affiliated with multiple research groups including those led by <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/cover.html">Gwen Eadie</a>, <a href="http://dunlap.utoronto.ca/~bgaensler/">Bryan Gaensler</a>, <a href="http://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/">Jo Bovy</a>, <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~abraham/Web/Welcome.html">Bob Abraham</a>, and <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~drout/">Maria Drout</a>.

	<a id="open-science" class="anchor" href="#open-science" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Science</h2>
      <p>
    I am a big proponent of open, accessible, and reproducible science. When conducting research, my collaborators and I make an active effort to share all of the results, data products, and code along with <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/czucker/Paper_Figures/summary_fig.html">interactive visualizations</a> from our projects in order to enable readers to fully explore our findings for themselves. I also make an effort to ensure <a href="https://github.com/joshspeagle/">my code</a> remains public throughout its development and is well-documented when officially released to the wider community.
      </p>

	<a id="teaching" class="anchor" href="#teaching" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
    I have a strong interest in education and pedagogy, with a focus on practical skills such as programming, applied statistics, and data science that are invaluable but not often taught as part of a typical science curriculum. As part of my teaching, I try to develop online, interactive, and publicly available resources that facilitate "flipped classroom" environments focused on encouraging student engagement. A few examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/AstroHackWeek/AstroHackWeek2020/blob/master/bayesianinference-1/Introduction%20to%20Bayesian%20Inference%20with%20Linear%20Regression%20(complete).ipynb">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/banneker-aztlan/intro-to-python">here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sgossage/BI2019---Python-Course">here</a>. I also work on publishing pedagogical texts <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12313">like this</a> that can serve as useful resources for students and instructors alike. See my <a href="https://github.com/joshspeagle/bio-cv/blob/gh-pages/teaching_speagle.pdf">Teaching Statement</a> for additional details.
      </p>
	    
      <p>
    I also am a firm believer in peer-to-peer knowledge exchange as an integral part of learning about science and serve as an active participate in many journal clubs and discussion groups. In particular, I founded and organized the Machine Learning Journal Club at the <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/">Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian</a> from 2017-2020, and am currently serving as the co-founder/organizer for the Statistics & MachIne LEarning Journal Club (SMILE) in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto.

	<a id="Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion" class="anchor" href="#EDI" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion</h2>
      <p>
    For centuries, explicit and implicit discrimination have barred individuals from many backgrounds from participating fully and freely in science. As scientists and people, I feel we have a duty to address these injustices to both better our profession as well as society at large. I endeavor to create an environment in which all members feel that their diverse backgrounds are an integral part of being a scientist rather than something that excludes them from being a valued member of the scientific community.
      </p>

      <p>
    Improving equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in the sciences is important component of all my work. My past, present, and future efforts aim to tackle these issues through a multi-faceted set of initiatives including making curricula more inclusive, creating dedicated skills training programs, establishing avenues for institutional support, assisting in building up communities, expanding outreach efforts, increasing data collection, and improving representation. See my <a href="https://github.com/joshspeagle/bio-cv/blob/gh-pages/edi_speagle.pdf">EDI Statement</a> for additional details.
