      <p>
	I am currently an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="http://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/filter_by/graduate-student/">Harvard University Department of Astronomy</a> working with <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/deisenstein/">Daniel Eisenstein</a> and <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/home/">Charlie Conroy</a>. My research broadly focuses on trying to extract as much information as possible from large extragalactic surveys in reasonable amounts of time. This involves both developing complex statistical models to conduct rigorous Bayesian inference and subsequently leveraging machine learning to scale them up to large datasets. I am especially interested in the ''dregs of science'' regime where lots of data are available but are [1] observed at low signal-to-noise and [2] plagued by large (possibly unknown) systematics, since these datasets offer up a wide variety of interesting data modeling challenges and often contain hidden gems (i.e. useful science results) that otherwise would remain buried.

      <p>
	Before becoming a graduate student, I spent a year (2015-2016) as a Project Academic Support Staff at the <a href="http://www.ipmu.jp/">Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe</a> (Kavli IPMU), where I worked with <a href="http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/about_department/people/faculty/singleton.php?&singleton=true&cruz_id=alexie">Alexie Leauthaud</a> and <a href="http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/singleton.php?&singleton=true&cruz_id=kbundy">Kevin Bundy</a> on improving <a href="http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/science/photometric-redshfits/">photometric redshifts</a> for the <a href="http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/">Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program</a> (HSC SSP) Survey. This work was partly funded by the <a href="http://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/about/index.html">CREST program</a> from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).
      </p>

      <p>
	Prior to my time at Kavli IPMU, I was a student at Harvard University (Class of 2015) where I completed my BA in Astrophysics and Physics.
