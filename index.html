      <h2> Who am I? </h2>

      <p style="text-align:center;font-size:120%;">
<b>Note that I am on leave until Nov 2025.</b>
      </p>

      <p style="font-size:80%;">
During my leave, I am working as a Research Scientist at <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/river-run-trading/>River Run Trading</a>. Please direct business-related inquiries to <a href="mailto:joshspeagle@rtwotrading.com">joshspeagle@rtwotrading.com</a>. University-related inquiries should still be directed to <a href="mailto:j.speagle@utoronto.ca">j.speagle@utoronto.ca</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
I am an <b>Assistant Professor of Astrostatistics</b> jointly appointed between the <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/">Department of Statistical Sciences</a> and the <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/">David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. I am also an Associate Member of the <a href="https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/">Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics</a> as well as a Member of the <a href="https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/">Data Sciences Institute</a>. More information about me can be found on my <a href="https://joshspeagle.com/bio-cv/">Personal page</a>.
      </p>

      <h2> What do I do? </h2>

      <p>
<b>My research focuses on using a combination of astronomy, statistics, and data science to understand the how galaxies like our own Milky Way form, behave, and evolve over time.</b> This often involves working with massive datasets from wide-field imaging and spectroscopic surveys containing observations ranging from billions of stars and galaxies to interstellar gas and dust. I also teach both undergraduate and graduate courses in statistics and astronomy, serve on a few committees (both within the University of Toronto and some professional societies such as the <a href="https://aas.org/">AAS</a>, <a href=https://astrostat.org/>ASA-AIG</a>, and <a href=https://ssc.ca/en/about/sections-regions/data-science-and-analytics>SSC-DSA</a>), and help manage the <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/academics/undergraduate-studies/surp-2/">Astronomy & Astrophysics Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)</a> (the largest of its kind in Canada!).
      </p>

      <h2> Who do I work with? </h2>

      <p>
I am incredibly fortunate to co-lead the interdisciplinary <b><a href=https://astrostatuoft.com/>Astrostatistics Research Team (ART)</a></b> along with <a href=https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/cover.html>Gwen Eadie</a>. For more information about the people involved and the research we do, please check out our <b><a href=https://astrostatuoft.com/>homepage</a></b>!
      </p>

      <h2> Interested in learning more? </h2>

      <p>
If would like to get in touch, my email address is <a href="mailto:j.speagle@utoronto.ca">j.speagle@utoronto.ca</a>. My offices are UY 9108 (Statistical Sciences) and AB 206 (Astronomy & Astrophysics), although the odds of pinning me down in one of my offices without setting up an appointment first are likely pretty slim!

      <p style="font-size:80%;">
<b>If you are interested in working with me as a Master's or Ph.D. student</b>: Please be aware that while you are welcome to reach out to chat about my work, I cannot directly admit graduate students. If you are interested in potentially working with me, I would instead encourage you to apply to the Department of Statistical Sciences and/or David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics Master's/Doctoral program streams. If you are admitted, I would be happy to discuss further potential collaboration opportunities.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size:80%;">
<b>If you are interested in working with me as an undergraduate student</b>: Please be aware that while you are welcome to reach out to chat about my work, my general policy is not to accept students through ad hoc channels. Instead, I often post opportunities through existing program streams in order to ensure a broader cohort of potential applicants whose materials can be reviewed in a more inclusive and equitable manner. <br>

If you are a <i>current University of Toronto student</i>, opportunities include: the <a href=https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/experiential-learning/research-opportunities/research-opportunities-program>Faculty of Arts & Science Research Opportunity Program (ROP)</a>, the <a href=https://registrar.utoronto.ca/finances-and-funding/work-study-program/>University of Toronto Work Study Program (WSP)</a>, and the Department of Statistical Sciences Summer Undergraduate Research Award (only eligible for upper-level Statistical Science majors and specialists), as well as  independent study courses (e.g., <a href=https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ast430h1>AST 430</a>, <a href=https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/sta496h1>STA 496</a>) or thesis/capstone research classes (e.g., <a href=https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ast425y1>AST 425</a>). <br>

If you are a <i>Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or hold a valid student permit</i> (i.e. you do not need to go through <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship.html>IRCC</a> to accept a position), opportunities include: the <a href=https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/academics/undergraduate-studies/surp-2/>Astronomy & Astrophysics Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)</a> and the <a href=https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/suds/>Data Sciences Institute's Summer Undergraduate Data Science (SUDS) Opportunities Program</a>. <br>

Finally, if you are an <i>international student</i> who does not belong in any of the above categories (i.e. you would need to apply for a student/work permit through IRCC), opportunities include: the <a href=https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-internship-students/>Mitacs Globalink Research Internship (GRI)</a> and <a href=https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-award-students-postdocs/>Globalink Research Award</a>.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size:80%;">
<b>If you are interested in working with me from outside a university setting</b>: Please be aware that while you are welcome to reach out to chat about my work, I might not be able to match your interest or have opportunities available for you. While I have worked with high school students and non-traditional applicants before (e.g., through <a href=https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/admissions/about-co-op>co-op placements</a>), I generally prefer to partner with existing programs such as <a href=https://www.vosnl.org/>Visions of Science</a>.
